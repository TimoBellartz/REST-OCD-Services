# Cooperation Simulation

WebOCD allows you to run various cooperation simulation algorithms on the networks. To do so, you need to navigate to the [page](/REST-OCD-Services/pages/tutorials/networks-covers-view#specific-network) of the desired network. And click on _Run Cooperation Simulation_ tab. Here you need to select the name, as well as the desired game, dynamic and break condition for the simulation.

In the example below, we choose __Snow Drift Game__ and enter desired parameters and we choose 5 iterations as input.

When all the parameters inputted, you click on the &nbsp;  ![simulate-btn](/REST-OCD-Services/assets/img/simulate_btn.png "Simulate Button") &nbsp; button to run the simulation.

To view all available simulation results, you need to click on the _Simulations_ button on the navbar.

# Simulation Groups

On the simulations page, you have the option to group simulations together. To do this you need to select simulations we want in the group and the group name. Then you need to click the ![group-btn](/REST-OCD-Services/assets/img/group_btn.png "Cooperation Simulation Group") &nbsp; button. For example, below we group _Simulation-1_ and _Simulation-2_ in a group called _Sim-Tutorial-Group_.

To access all the groups, you need to click the ![simulation-groups-btn](/REST-OCD-Services/assets/img/group_btn.png "Simulation Groups Button") &nbsp; button.

# Viewing Simulations

To view details about the simulation, you need to click on the name of the desired simulation simulation. This is shown on the images below. Here we can see information about the simulation.
