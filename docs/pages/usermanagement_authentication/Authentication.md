# Authentication

Although possible, it is not recommended to use the service without user authentication. Through authentication a user can manage its own graphs, covers, etc. Without authentication all data is shared with anybody else using the service anonymously and thus may be altered or deleted by other users.

Information on how to create a new user is given below.

Once you have a valid user account you can authenticate through [Basic Authentication](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication). The authentication header has to be sent with every single request.
