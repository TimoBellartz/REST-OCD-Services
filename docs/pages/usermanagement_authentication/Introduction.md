# Introduction
The OCD Service's authentication and user management is based on the user agents of the underlying LAS2peer network. This page will just give a brief overview over some of the most important aspects, however this information might become outdated at any point. For more and up-to-date information on authentication and user management in LAS2peer networks and services please refer to the [LAS2peer project documentation](https://github.com/rwth-acis/las2peer-template-project/wiki/WebConnector%3A-Request-Authentication).
This part deals with manually adding users which should not be necessary if you use the [OCD Web Client](https://github.com/rwth-acis/OCD-Web-Client) or OIDC login for the service. In this case, the underlying las2peer webconnector will create and log in Users according to their Accounts from the OIDC provider.
